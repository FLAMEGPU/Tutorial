It is capable of running code in a wide variety of programming languages. Once the instance is up and running, you can simply click on the links, and start the tutorial in the web based environment. The notebook consists of cells which can be of type code or markdown (by default, new cells are created as *code* cells). If the content is code, it will be sent to the kernel for execution and output will be displayed in the footer of the cell. If the content is markdown, it will be rendered as HTML and serves as explanatory text. You can execute the content by clicking the **_Run_** button. \n",
